# translate_and_notify
these simple scripts are made just to make translations of selected text using google translate and show results via notify-osd

Requirements:
1. xsel library to catch selection
2. notify-osd to send notifications
3. Ruby or Python installations

Usage: basicaly you need to select some text and run rseltr, but its better to assign some hot-key

Notes: Python script is working longer and using more resources may be because I'm noob =)
