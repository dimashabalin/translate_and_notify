# translate_and_notify
these simple scripts are made just to make translations of selected text using google translate and show results via notify-osd

Requirements:
1. xsel library to catch selection\n
2. notify-osd to send notifications\n
3. Ruby or Python installations\n

Usage: basicaly you need to select some text and run rseltr, but its better to assign some hot-key, don't forget to set ruby/python environment in script or .profile appropriately.

Notes: Python script is working longer and using more resources may be because I'm noob =)
